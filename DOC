=======================================
Anytris: Tetris was Tetris for a reason
=======================================

A Tetris-like game, more elucidative than entertaining.

As you possibly know, the Greek suffix "tetra" means "four". Tetris
was named "Tetris" because all the pieces in the game made of four
blocks. OK, this explains the name, but not the choice of four. Why
weren't the pieces made of, say, three or five blocks?

In Anytris, before starting the game, you select how many blocks will
be used to make up each piece. You can chose to play "Monotris",
"Ditris", "Tritris", "Pentrix", "Hexatris", "Heptrix", "Octrix",
"Enneatrix" or "Decatrix" -- but not "Tetris".

I guess this will help people to understand why Tetris was Tetris.

[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), by Alexey Pajitnov, is
the original design from which dozens of variations (including
Anytris) evolved.

[ntris](http://ntris.mit.edu/singleplayer.html), by Shaunak Kishore,
is another Tetris variation in which pieces may be composed by a
number of blocks different than four. Unlike Anytris (and Tetris, for
that matter), in ntris the number of blocks forming a piece is not
fixed during a game. Also unlike Anytris (but like Tetris), ntris
seems to be designed to be fun.
